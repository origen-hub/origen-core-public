# Security

OriGen’s security model is not an add‑on. It emerges directly from the architecture: explicit definitions, immutable toolchains, pure planning, and isolated execution.

This section introduces the two core security consequences of that design:

* **Zero‑Trust‑by‑Design** — why verification becomes cheap when ambiguity is removed.
* **Automatic Digital Provenance (ADP)** — how determinism and digest‑pinned toolchains create provenance automatically.

Together, these concepts form the foundation of OriGen’s security posture.
