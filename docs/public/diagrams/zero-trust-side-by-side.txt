Traditional Systems                      OriGen

- implicit tools                         - tools declared in Maps/Navigators
- mutable base images                    - toolchains pinned by digest
- inherited host env                     - no environment inheritance
- runtime discovery                      - no discovery during planning
- hidden side effects                    - pure, side-effect-free planning
- shared mutable state                   - immutable Route as intent
- executors that reinterpret intent      - Guides translate only, never execute
