# Privacy

OriGen’s documentation uses **GoatCounter**, a privacy-respecting analytics tool,
to understand which pages are most useful to readers.

GoatCounter is intentionally minimal:

- no cookies
- no tracking identifiers
- no fingerprinting
- no personal data collection
- no cross-site tracking
- fully open-source
- data is stored only in aggregate form

Analytics help guide documentation improvements by showing which topics readers
find valuable (for example: Zero-Trust, ADP, Downsweep, or the Primer).

No behavioral profiles are created, and no information is shared with third parties.

If you prefer to opt out globally, GoatCounter provides a built-in opt-out:
https://www.goatcounter.com/help/privacy

If you have questions about how this documentation is served or built,
you can reach the maintainers via the project’s issue tracker.
